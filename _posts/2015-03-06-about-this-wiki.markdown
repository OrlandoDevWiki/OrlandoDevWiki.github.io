This wiki was created with the idea that the Orlando developer and designer communities could share useful information with each other.

Good candidates for information include:

- What events the community should know about
- What meetups happen in different categories
- What places are good for coworking
- Any other information about Orlando that would be useful to new and existing members of the community.

It's mostly in validation phases, but it could end up becoming really cool. Or it could fail, in which case it will be removed.

To contribute, [visit the wiki](https://github.com/OrlandoDevWiki/OrlandoDevWiki.github.io) and submit a pull request, or email jaxbot -at- gmail to request contributor access to the repo.
