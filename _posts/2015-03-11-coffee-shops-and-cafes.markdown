Here's an in-progress list of places that are laptop-friendly in Orlando.

## East Orlando / UCF Area

### [Vespr](http://thevespr.com/)

[Map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vespr+Craft+Coffee+%26+Allures/@28.555688,-81.207649,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x88e767cb4c6adf0b:0x9648c3e057cc56b6)

Craft coffee, laptop-friendly. Relaxed environment but can get very busy at times.

### [Boston Coffeehouse](http://www.thebostoncoffeehouse.com/)

### [Barnie's Coffee](http://www.barniesoviedo.com/)

Relatively small compared to the above two.

### UCF

Parking and internet login make this less practical for most people, but for students and faculty, the following places work well:

#### Tech Commons

Lots of chairs and tables plus the Bits & Bytes cafe

#### Student Union

Chairs on the upper floor walkways give a relatively non-distracting place to work

#### Library

Can be crowded on the main floors, but upper floors can be great for working in silence.

#### Book Store

The tables and bars next to the Starbucks are usually great candidates for peaceful working and coffee consumption.

## Winterpark

### [Stardust](https://stardustvideoandcoffee.wordpress.com/)

Chill atmosphere, great coffee, laptop-friendly.
