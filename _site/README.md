Experimenting with the idea of having an Orlando Developer related wiki

This is all very prototypal. Idea via @PhillyC (seneca on Orlando Dev slack). If there are any name disputes, ownership trouble, etc, message @Jaxbot. This repo/organization are not meant to claim ownership of anything, just wanted a nice URL to experiment with this idea.

If you would like to become a contributor/owner, let Jaxbot know.

If the idea doesn't take off, this repo/organization will be deleted.
